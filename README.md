# my-portfolio
My current portfolio -- still under construction.

At this stage website is created for mobile screens only (as I started with "mobile first" approach in mind). 
Design-wise: I am thinking about limiting patterned background just to two sections of the website and adding some eye-catching icons to header
(but I have to find them -- or create them -- first). 
Technology-wise: I need to look for best solution for "about this site" section and finish "portfolio" section. 

Enjoy :).
